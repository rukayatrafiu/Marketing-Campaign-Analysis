# MARKETING-CAMPAIGN-ANALYSIS

## Background/Introduction

This is a summary of the Maven Analytics Marketing Campaign Results Analysis project. The objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the marketing campaign, identify areas for improvement, and measure overall success. The analysis and reporting were conducted using ***Microsoft Excel***.
## Data Description

The dataset contains marketing campaign data of 2,240 customers of Maven Marketing, including customer profiles, product preferences, campaign successes/failures and channel performance.

## Problem Statement

This analysis tends to answer the following questions

1. What factors are significantly related to the number of web purchases?
2. Which marketing campaign was the most successful?
3. What does the average customer look like?
4. Which products are performing best?
5. Which channels are underperforming?

## Recommendations

- To improve sales productivity, discounts should be offered on lower-performing products like gold, fish, sweets, and fruits.

- The Maven website should be optimized for easier navigation, particularly targeting international customers, to enhance online purchases.

- Campaign Unit 2, which significantly underperformed, should be integrated into other more successful campaign units (like Units 3, 4, and 5) to learn better strategies and improve outcomes.

- Given that Spain generated the highest sales, additional marketing efforts should be focused on this region to capitalize on its revenue potential.
